spacecat-swift-newfeatures
==========================

##About

A Swift version of the Treehouse course app SpaceCat, extended with new, custom features. Starting out with the ported final version I plan to add these features on my own.

##New features

* ~~More differentiation between enemies: The dog in the spaceship should be able to move faster than the other one (makes sense!), but should also award more points for this reason. Both should be modified by about 20%~~
* ~~Continuing on that, the spaceship dog should produce a bigger explosion as well as more debris, or rather the other dog should have less of both compared to current~~
* About screen, or rather a scrollable/-ing sidebar
* ~~Add mute button to gamescreen~~
* ~~Clear remaining space dogs on game over, no need to have them around~~
* Possible performance enhancements: the App Store version lags at later stages on an iPhone 5 even
* GamePlayScene.swift is too large should be refactores or at least split into shorter logical parts using extensions 

##Nice to have features

Advanced features that would make a more compelling experience, but require lot of work. 

* Game Center integration: achievements, leaderboards etc.
* Social integration: post score to Facebook and/or Twitter
* Push notifications: ain't nothing like nagging the user to come and play :)
* Projectile throttling: currently spamming taps is a viable strategy, should be reworked. Enemy spawn rate should be adjusted obviously
* Powerup system: extra lives etc. Powerups should fall down just like enemies. List of possible powerups:
    * 1up
    * 2x shooting speed for 10 seconds
    * freeze enemies and stop new spawns for 5 seconds
    * invulnerability for 5 seconds (dogs hitting ground still die but don't cost lives)
* New music: admittedly I'm not a big fan of the music, it's not bad, but too repetitive. Should be able to compose something more diverse in Garageband from different loops
* iPad version: don't see this happening but gonna make note of it anyway :)
